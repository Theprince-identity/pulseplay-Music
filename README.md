PulsePlay is a web-based music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating SoundCloud for song streaming. The player offers a simple and elegant interface, allowing users to control playback, track progress, and enjoy uninterrupted music streaming.

Features
Seamless Music Streaming: Stream songs directly from SoundCloud using embedded players.
Interactive Controls: Play, pause, and skip songs with responsive UI elements.
Progress Bar Control: Syncs with the current song, allowing users to seek within the track.
Automatic Next Track: Automatically plays the next song in the playlist when the current one finishes.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Embedded Playlist: A list of pre-selected songs with each song represented by a custom UI, providing a smooth user experience.

Tech Stack
HTML: Structure and layout of the player.
CSS: Styling the layout and ensuring the player is responsive across devices.
JavaScript: Handling player functionality, including integration with the SoundCloud API for controlling playback, progress, and track management.

How It Works
The app embeds SoundCloud songs using iframes and uses SoundCloudâ€™s JavaScript SDK to control playback.
When you click the play button, the corresponding song starts playing, and the progress bar updates in real-time.
Once a song finishes, the next song in the playlist is automatically played.
External links, like the "SoundCloud" icon, are disabled to prevent redirection outside the player.
